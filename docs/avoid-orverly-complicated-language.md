**Why?** Cross-team communication between engineers, marketing, and non-technical decision-makers can be challenging if technical jargon and acronyms are open.

--

1. **Limit jargon and acronyms:**
   - Minimize technical jargon and unexpanded acronyms that may need more widely understood.
   - Use everyday language that is accessible to a broader audience.

2. **Contractions aren't bad - use them!**
   - Contractions, such as "isn't" or "can't," are acceptable and can make your writing more conversational and approachable.

3. **Use everyday words:**
   - Opt for ordinary, everyday words instead of obscure or pretentious language. Avoid circumlocutions and lengthy words that may confuse or alienate readers.

### Types of Jargon

- Necessary technical terms: Utilize technical terms essential for understanding the subject matter, but provide explanations or context when introducing them.
- Obscure and pretentious language: Avoid using convoluted or lengthy words, archaic phrases like "herby" or "wherefore," and excessive Latin terminology.

--

### Limiting acronyms and abbreviations

- Use "we" to refer to the organization or team.
- Avoid using acronyms or abbreviations for infrequent phrases. Spell out acronyms that are not commonly known and repeat their full form (e.g., "3-47").
- Consider adopting a different writing style that favors pronounceable acronyms (e.g., "SQL" pronounced as "sequel").

--

### Place words carefully

- Keep subjects and objects close to their verbs to improve clarity.
- Utilize contractions to create a more conversational tone.
- Position conditionals such as "only" or "always" next to the words they modify.
- Avoid misplaced modifiers that can lead to confusion.
- Place exceptions and long conditions after the main clause rather than before or in the middle.

### Don't make readers do your thinking for you

- Reduce duplication, redundancy, and unnecessary language to ensure your writing is concise.
