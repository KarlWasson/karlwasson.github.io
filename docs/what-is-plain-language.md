It's July 19, 2009, and Alex, a tech-savvy individual, is searching for a SIM-only carrier or plan in the United States. Alex doesn't want to be tied to a subsidized phone or a long-term contract and prefers a more flexible and affordable option. With this in mind, Alex turns to the Hacker News community, seeking advice and recommendations from fellow users.

Alex opens a web browser and navigates to Hacker News, a popular online forum for tech enthusiasts. After creating an account, Alex clicks on the "Ask HN" section to post a new question. The post's title reads: "Any good SIM-only carriers or plans in the US?"

In the post's body, Alex writes:
"Hey HN community, I'm currently looking for a SIM-only carrier or plan in the US. I don't want to be tied down to a subsidized phone or a contract. My main priority is finding an affordable option with flexible terms. If anyone has any recommendations or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks in advance."
