## User-Centric Approach

Consider which documents help people achieve their goals on your website or in your technical marketing materials.

## External Documents

These are documents customers and clients need to:

- Use your product
- Contact your company
- Buy your product
- Learn about your product
- Obtain information about your services or product

### Examples of External Documents

- Technical documentation
- Forms
- Web copy
- How-to articles
- Sales assets
- White papers
- Blogs

## Internal Documents

These are documents relevant to internal operations and communication:

- Process documentation
- Sales battle cards
- Emails
- Job descriptions
- Requests

**Activity 3: Match the goal to the information in the document:**
Find examples of easy-to-use documentation. Check off the language techniques you find in the document.

For example, [Mozilla MDN Web Documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn).
