- Break up the information into sections.
- Increase blank space to enhance readability.
- Informative headings help the reader navigate the document.

### 3. Use lists

- Make it easier for the reader to grasp all items or steps in a process.
- Add blank space for easy reading and visual separation.
- Lists help readers see the structure of your document.
- Make lists shorter, as long lists can be challenging to navigate.
- Consider grouping items into subgroups or organizing them alphabetically.

### 4. Use tables

- Tables help save words, make finding specific information more accessible, and establish connections.
- Tables can present provisions, facilities, services, amenities, resources, equipment, arrangements, solutions, means, offerings, funds, benefits, and assistance.
- Tables make it easy to glance at complex material and clarify your logic and structure.
- Note: Online behavior, such as scanning for answers, also applies in offline contexts.
